# Car Parking Management System project
Ddescription : 
Your car parking management system is your first project, which is based on the intermediate level of the C++ programming language. In this project, I have added the capability for customers to book parking spots themselves. When a customer makes a booking, they will need to provide their bank account number and PIN code for payment. Once the payment is completed, the parking spot will be reserved for them.

Additionally, there is a feature for the parking system administrator to view records and change the pricing for all cars. If the admin wants to change the pricing, they can do it directly from the output screen without needing to access the source code. For security purposes, an ID and password have been pre-set for the admin.

1) Customer Booking: Customers can independently reserve parking spots. To complete the booking, customers will be required to provide their bank account number and PIN code for payment. Once the payment is processed, the parking spot will be confirmed.

2) Admin Control: The parking system administrator can access records and modify the pricing for all cars.

3) Price Adjustment: To modify the pricing, the administrator can conveniently use the output screen without the need to access the source code.

4) Security: For security purposes, an ID and password have been predefined for the admin.
